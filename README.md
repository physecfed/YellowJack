# Yellow Jack
Named after the "Lima" (L) signal flag used to indicate a ship under quarantine, Yellow Jack is an experiment in the development of a Unix-like operating system designed to see just how complete of an operating system one can develop while stuck at home during a pandemic.

High-level goals for Yellow Jack are:
 1. Implement a proof-of-concept Unix-form microkernel
 2. Be capable of multitasking (running multiple processes simultaneously)
 3. Develop useful drivers for most commonplace hardware (HDDs, USB, PCIe, TCP/IP, etc.)
 4. Have a stable Unix/POSIX API suitable for general applications development

While this project is in the early phases, I recommend that you view the [project wiki](https://github.com/physecfed/YellowJack/wiki) to get a better sense of the project, what its goals are and how it is being developed.
